# Prompt for starting new iteration

I'm developing a Claude skill for NCI Imaging Data Commons to be contributed to https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills, which already has many scientific skills. Here's the current state:

The skill is in scientific-skills/imaging-data-commons/SKILL.md in the source tree. Analyze the current content before doing anything. 

When testing idc-index package make a python environment using the uv already installed on the system in /Users/af61/.cargo/bin/uv. Whenever suggesting code snippets, validate by running the code in python. 

Current status: I am reviewing the content and will be asking you to add features and revisit specific components. Whenever you notice that the definition of the skill does not follow the conventions in the repository, or best practices for developing a claude skill, alert me and suggest changes.

Next task: [specific refinement needed]

Please review the skill and [specific action].
