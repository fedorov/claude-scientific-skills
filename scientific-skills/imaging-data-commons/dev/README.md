# Prompt for starting new iteration

I'm developing a Claude skill for NCI Imaging Data Commons to be contributed to https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills.

**IMPORTANT**: Before analyzing the repository from scratch, check if `scientific-skills/imaging-data-commons/dev/repo-analysis.md` exists in the source tree. If it does, read it and use that cached analysis instead of re-analyzing.

If the analysis file doesn't exist or I ask you to refresh it, analyze the repository and save your findings to `scientific-skills/imaging-data-commons/dev/repo-analysis.md` for future reuse.

The skill is in scientific-skills/imaging-data-commons/SKILL.md in the source tree.
